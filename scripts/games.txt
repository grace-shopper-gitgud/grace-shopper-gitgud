A certain type of star even transforms him into Super Yoshi, giving him the ability to fly through the sky or run along walls and ceilings.

[{"id":1284,"name":"Lollipop Chainsaw","slug":"lollipop-chainsaw","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/lollipop-chainsaw","created_at":1346785986619,"updated_at":1517270786185,"summary":"Lollipop Chainsaw is the 'un-deadly' story of sweet and killer zombie hunter Juliet Starling and her quest to uncover the root of a colossal zombie outbreak. With her wickedly awesome chainsaw in hand, Juliet slices, dices and splits her way through hordes of the undead, but soon realizes the horde is only the opening act to a festival of zombie rock lords determined to kill the chainsaw wielding cheerleader.","storyline":"On Juliet Starling's (voiced by Tara Strong in English and Eri Kitamura/Yōko Hikasa in Japanese) 18th birthday, she goes to San Romero High School park to meet her boyfriend, Nick Carlyle (voiced by Michael Rosenbaum in English and Kenichi Suzumura in Japanese) who is going to meet her family for the first time. Unfortunately, a zombie outbreak has occurred, which leads to Juliet fighting off hordes of Undead on her way to meet Nick. When she arrives, she discovers Nick fighting off a zombie which was trying to eat her, and so Nick is bitten in her place. Realizing he will become a zombie, Juliet decides she must decapitate him to save him. \nWhen he comes to, Nick discovers he is somehow still alive, despite being a severed head, and so Juliet reveals to him that she is a zombie hunter, and that she performed a magical ritual on him which keeps his soul from being turned into a zombie and retaining his humanity, thus explaining his continued existence as a severed head. Juliet attaches Nick's head to her belt, and she fights hordes of zombies on her way to meet her tutor, Morikawa (voiced by Bruce Locke in English and Bin Shimada in Japanese). Once they are united, Morikawa explains the situation, and explains that the Universe is divided into three realms: Earth, the Land Beyond Words, and the Rotten World, an infernal realm where demons and zombies reside.[7] Morikawa tells Juliet and Nick that somebody has cracked open a portal between Earth and the Rotten World by a combination of black magic and explosives, and Morikawa sets out to find the culprit. Juliet reunites again with Morikawa after fighting zombies intent on blowing her to oblivion, and finds the person responsible for the outbreak, an evil goth named Swan (voiced by Sean Gunn in English and Nobuhiko Okamoto in Japanese) but she cannot prevent him from summoning five demons to the world, which take the form of zombies centered on themes of rock and roll.[8] Morikawa attempts to stop Swan from unleashing the demons, but he is mortally wounded. \nSwan sends the first zombie overlord, Zed (voiced by Jimmy Urine in English and Shintaro Asanuma in Japanese), after her, but she kills him in a fight and sends him back to the Rotten World. Morikawa tells her to purify the school and kill the four remaining zombie overlords before dying. Juliet hunts down the overlords, while receiving advice from her sisters Cordelia Starling (voiced by Linda Cardellini in English and Mayumi Asano in Japanese), the elder one, and Rosalind Starling (voiced by Kimberly Brooks in English and Mariya Ise in Japanese), the younger sister.[9] Juliet continues exploring the school and fighting zombies, and encounters Vikke, the second zombie overlord summoned by Swan, whom she duels onboard his airborne longship and sends him back to Rotten World. The longship crashes into the O'Bannon Farm. Juliet is attacked mentally by nightmares projected from Mariska, the zombie Queen of Psychedelia, but Juliet eventually shakes off the nightmares and faces Mariska herself, defeating her and sending her back to Rotten World. Juliet's father, Gideon, arrives and takes her back to the city, where Juliet, Nick and Gideon infiltrate the Fulci Fun Center upon realizing it is full of gamer zombies. Josey, the zombie overlord in charge of the center, summons Juliet to his lair atop the building, and in a duel, Juliet also defeats him. Finally with one zombie overlord left, Juliet's family all team up to infiltrate an unfinished Cathedral in the heart of the city, where the final overlord, Lewis Legend, lurks. Upon accessing his lair, Swan taunts Juliet about Lewis being more than a match for her; ultimately, though, the situation is reversed. Just like all the other overlords upon their deaths, Lewis utters a Latin chant. \nSwan appears and applauds Juliet for her work and reveals the cruel fact that she was a pawn in his game, and he allowed all the zombie overlords to die so the true zombie lord could be returned to this world. Swan also tells Juliet that it was she, and all the other students at the school, that made him into a monster through torture and bullying. (However, the flashbacks shown imply that Swan might have had feelings for Juliet and that her relationship with Nick pushed him further over the edge.) Essentially, the zombie outbreak was his act of vengeance against the school's students, and society in general for making him an outcast. Juliet tries to reason with him, but Swan, indifferent towards any attempt to get him to see the error of his ways, shoots his head off to finish the ritual and is absorbed along with the rest of the Undead into a black vortex, which solidifies into the zombie of all zombies: Killabilly, whom Juliet is forced to fight. \nJuliet battles Killabilly and is contacted by the ghost of Morikawa, who gives her advice along with Nick. Halfway through the fight, Gideon drives his motorcycle packed with explosives into the maw of Killabilly, and is seemingly destroyed. Juliet mourns her father, but Nick and Morikawa encourage her to enter the mouth of Killabilly before he regenerates. Juliet complies and lands in the demon's stomach, where, in his heart, she encounters Swan's headless corpse. She learns she must put Nick's head on top of Swan's body to make Killabilly explode into nothing, and tearfully does so after expressing her love for Nick. Nick tells her he loves her, and sacrifices himself for humanity. Killabilly explodes, and in a near-death experience Nick learns from Morikawa's ghost that it has been decided Nick's honour grants him new life, with a new body, but there will be a \"mix-up\" on the resurrection. Nick learns this means he gets Morikawa's body, which is far shorter than his previous one, but neither he nor Juliet really care. Eventually, it is revealed Gideon did survive the explosion, and together the Starling family make their way home in return for Juliet's birthday, which can be a positive or negative experience depending on how the game has been played. \nShould the player save all available people during the course of the game, Juliet's birthday will go swimmingly and Nick will present his present of a box of luxury lollipops to Juliet. If the player allows one or more people to die, however, Juliet's mother will act strangely and turn around to reveal she has been zombified.","rating":66.8289477079694,"popularity":2.333333333333333,"aggregated_rating":69,"aggregated_rating_count":11,"total_rating":67.9144738539847,"total_rating_count":29,"rating_count":18,"games":[6958,27421,7329,1009,9655,4786,7603,22486,1082,9927],"tags":[1,27,268435481,536870933,536870991,536870992,536870998,536871041,536871138,536871208,536871262,536871315,536871682,536871758,536871958,536872205,536872225,536872232,536872511,536873455,536874452,536874745,536875057,536875073,536875100,536875153,536875154,536875157,536875257,536875271,536875281,536875338,536875364,536875406,536875413,536875420,536875437,536875480,536875493,536875523,536875526,536875527,536875565,536875802,536875808,536875885,536875895,536875934,536876029,536876109,536876176,536876189,536876199,536876243,536876262,536876303,536876322,536876351,536876355,536876584,536876666,536876672,536876756,536876762,536876817,536876823,536876827,536876901,536876943,536877135,536877174,536877177,536877283,536877292,536877297,536877390,536877394,536877543,536877653,536877950,536878093,536878276,536878314,536878324,536878415,536879708,536880026,536880166,536880308,536880449,536880879,536881080,536881398,536882694,536882782,1073741826],"developers":[845],"publishers":[50,836],"game_engines":[6],"category":0,"time_to_beat":{"hastly":27600},"player_perspectives":[2],"game_modes":[1],"keywords":[21,79,80,86,129,226,296,350,403,770,846,1046,1293,1313,1320,1599,2543,3540,3833,4145,4161,4188,4241,4242,4245,4345,4359,4369,4426,4452,4494,4501,4508,4525,4568,4581,4611,4614,4615,4653,4890,4896,4973,4983,5022,5117,5197,5264,5277,5287,5331,5350,5391,5410,5439,5443,5672,5754,5760,5844,5850,5905,5911,5915,5989,6031,6223,6262,6265,6371,6380,6385,6478,6482,6631,6741,7038,7181,7364,7402,7412,7503,8796,9114,9254,9396,9537,9967,10168,10486,11782,11870],"themes":[1,27],"genres":[25],"first_release_date":1339459200000,"platforms":[9,12],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":9,"date":1339459200000,"region":2,"human":"2012-Jun-12","y":2012,"m":6},{"category":0,"platform":9,"date":1339718400000,"region":1,"human":"2012-Jun-15","y":2012,"m":6},{"category":0,"platform":12,"date":1339459200000,"region":2,"human":"2012-Jun-12","y":2012,"m":6},{"category":0,"platform":12,"date":1339545600000,"region":3,"human":"2012-Jun-13","y":2012,"m":6},{"category":0,"platform":9,"date":1339545600000,"region":3,"human":"2012-Jun-13","y":2012,"m":6},{"category":0,"platform":9,"date":1339632000000,"region":5,"human":"2012-Jun-14","y":2012,"m":6},{"category":0,"platform":12,"date":1339632000000,"region":5,"human":"2012-Jun-14","y":2012,"m":6},{"category":0,"platform":12,"date":1339718400000,"region":1,"human":"2012-Jun-15","y":2012,"m":6}],"alternative_names":[{"name":"ロリポップチェーンソー","comment":"Japanese title"},{"name":"Roripoppu Chēn Sō","comment":"Japanese title"}],"screenshots":[{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/zylpcydpcp9pubtcykaa.jpg","cloudinary_id":"zylpcydpcp9pubtcykaa","width":1280,"height":720},{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/jnbqz3aijesh11fjds7a.jpg","cloudinary_id":"jnbqz3aijesh11fjds7a","width":1280,"height":720},{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/jwgifhtwnlhxqienr0zr.jpg","cloudinary_id":"jwgifhtwnlhxqienr0zr","width":1280,"height":720},{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/xet3nwxblgoxesmp3svb.jpg","cloudinary_id":"xet3nwxblgoxesmp3svb","width":1280,"height":720},{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/csgxhklxdsqwjzwuua9p.jpg","cloudinary_id":"csgxhklxdsqwjzwuua9p","width":1920,"height":1080}],"videos":[{"name":"Talent Voices Vignette Video","video_id":"JJt-PSVEsec"},{"name":"Suck on this Trailer","video_id":"2WhYnul-eg8"},{"name":"Zom-be-gone Trailer","video_id":"AEFtVg1h3zM"},{"name":"Launch Trailer","video_id":"wWi9ETJ-Lng"},{"name":"Reveal Trailer","video_id":"S5-cq8DxOCQ"},{"name":"Haloween Trailer","video_id":"MoJ5_sGD1U8"},{"name":"Combat Trailer","video_id":"jiAZuja1dO4"},{"name":"Bosses Trailer","video_id":"MLpMLkAKxDY"},{"name":"A Romantic Valentine's Day Trailer","video_id":"YrZ2nDCSano"}],"cover":{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/jnljgvdqnqo0jzqnvcx3.jpg","cloudinary_id":"jnljgvdqnqo0jzqnvcx3","width":762,"height":939},"esrb":{"synopsis":"This is an action game in which players assume the role of Juliet Starling, a zombie-hunting cheerleader who must prevent the apocalypse. Players use a chainsaw, explosive rounds, and special attacks (e.g., performing cheerleading routines; mowing down enemies with a crop harvester) to kill zombies in melee-style combat. Some attacks (e.g., Sparkle Hunting Bonuses) require dispatching multiple zombies at once, and are highlighted by slow-motion effects and close-up camera angles. Cutscenes also depict over-the-top acts of violence: a zombie boss shooting himself in the head; characters getting sliced in half by chainsaws; Juliet punting a decapitated head in slow motion. Exaggerated blood splashes, dismemberment, and decapitation occur frequently. During the course of the game, players can dress Juliet in revealing outfits (e.g., Sexy Rider Suit, Sexy Seashell Bikini) that expose large amounts of cleavage and/or buttocks. Numerous jokes in the dialogue and on-screen text also reference sexual material (e.g., “Officer Stephanie sometimes used her nightstick to pleasure herself to yearbook photos,”“[She] had 'backdoor' sex with over three hundred sailors back in the day,”“Is it normal to have an erection as you die?”). A variety of sequences allude to drug use (e.g., “Old McDonald's been smoking too much weed,” and “[Influences:] Rick James, eight-foot piles of cocaine. . .”). The words “f**k,”“sh*t,” and “c*cksucker” can be heard in dialogue.","rating":6},"pegi":{"rating":5},"websites":[{"category":6,"url":"https://www.twitch.tv/directory/game/Lollipop%20Chainsaw/videos/all"},{"category":5,"url":"https://twitter.com/lollichainsaw"},{"category":4,"url":"https://www.facebook.com/LollipopPage"},{"category":3,"url":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lollipop_Chainsaw"},{"category":2,"url":"http://lollipopchainsaw.wikia.com/wiki/Lollipop_Chainsaw"},{"category":1,"url":"http://www.lollipopchainsaw.com"}]}]

The game includes 18 missions, each based on an episode of the TV show and introduced by Antonio 'Huggy Bear' Fargas. There is also a free roaming mode, in which the player explores the GTA-esque environment looking for action and trouble. \n \nLike the film, the game does not entirely play it straight. Starsky & Hutch are actually shooting a TV show, and the scoring for each mission reflects how ratings-friendly your driving is. You are awarded gold, silver or bronze medals for each mission depending on performance, and must get at least 1 gold and 2 silvers on season 1 for a second season to be commissioned, and 3 golds and 2 silvers in season 2 for there to be a third for you to play through. \n \nThe overall goal in each mission is usually to chase and destroy a criminal's car. There is always a secondary target as well. In addition, the player will gain viewers by hitting the bad guy, pulling off elaborate jumps and skids, nearly hitting civilians, and hitting the bonus targets such as canisters which are strewn through the levels. Hitting civilians will lose viewers.","franchise":244,"franchises":[244],"rating":67.0727701051554,"popularity":1.333333333333333,"aggregated_rating":64,"aggregated_rating_count":2,"total_rating":65.5363850525777,"total_rating_count":5,"rating_count":3,"games":[39,1905,11198,19419,28540,3772,665,36662,1877,1050],"tags":[1,33,268435466,536870934,536870937,536871033,536872695,536874539,536874824,536875054,536875069,536875095,536875154,536875257,536875262,536875291,536875413,536875453,536875483,536875523,536875564,536875572,536875650,536875688,536875689,536875777,536875792,536876261,536876289,536876564,536877030,536877275,536877319,536877451,536877585,536879167,536879184,536880757,536881347,536881647,536882450,536883143,536883605,536884207,1073741825,1073741826],"developers":[1691],"publishers":[340],"category":0,"player_perspectives":[1,2],"game_modes":[1,4],"keywords":[22,25,121,1783,3627,3912,4142,4157,4183,4242,4345,4350,4379,4501,4541,4571,4611,4652,4660,4738,4776,4777,4865,4880,5349,5377,5652,6118,6363,6407,6539,6673,8255,8272,9845,10435,10735,11538,12231,12693,13295],"themes":[1,33],"genres":[10],"first_release_date":1056067200000,"pulse_count":1,"platforms":[6,11,24,21,8],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":8,"date":1056067200000,"human":"2003-Jun-20","y":2003,"m":6},{"category":0,"platform":6,"date":1056067200000,"human":"2003-Jun-20","y":2003,"m":6},{"category":0,"platform":11,"date":1056067200000,"human":"2003-Jun-20","y":2003,"m":6},{"category":0,"platform":21,"date":1093305600000,"human":"2004-Aug-24","y":2004,"m":8},{"category":0,"platform":24,"date":1063324800000,"human":"2003-Sep-12","y":2003,"m":9}],"cover":{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/gjugns21pu5jp0pcpzjb.jpg","cloudinary_id":"gjugns21pu5jp0pcpzjb","width":256,"height":363},"esrb":{"rating":5}}]

The game follows a standard first-person shooter formula with the player taking on enemies over the course of a level. The New Order utilizes a health system in which the player's health is divided into separate sections that regenerate; if an entire section is lost, the player must use a health pack to replenish the missing health, in a similar fashion to games such as The Chronicles of Riddick: Escape from Butcher Bay and Resistance: Fall of Man. The player also has access to a non-limited weapon inventory, dual wielding certain weapons, as well as the ability to lean around, over and under cover, and perform a combat slide. Certain weapons also have special abilities such as a laser cannon which transforms into a cutting tool, and some turrets can be pulled from their stationary position and carried around. Semi-destructible environments have also been confirmed.","storyline":"Europe, 1946. World War II rages across Europe. Where once the Allies pressed advantage, the Nazi forces have turned the tide in dramatic fashion behind the technologically advanced war machine of General Wilhelm Strasse -- Deathshead. When a final Allied assault on Deathshead's compound fails, the Allies’ greatest hope falls with it. \n \nEurope, 1960. The war is over. And the Nazis are triumphant victors. Using unrelenting force and brutal intimidation, the Nazis have brought even the most powerful nations to their knees. The Nazi regime now rules the globe with an iron fist. \n \nYou are Captain B.J. Blazkowicz, the American War Hero. After emerging into this world of darkness, you must launch an impossible counter-offensive against the monstrous Nazi regime. Only you dare stand up against an unstoppable army of Nazi robots and hulking Super Soldiers. Only you can stop Deathshead. Only you can rewrite

is a first-person shooter in which players assume the role of a US Army Ranger as he battles Nazi forces between 1946 and 1960. Players use pistols, machine guns, sniper rifles, fantasy weapons, and explosives to kill enemy soldiers and robotic characters. Players can also sneak up on enemies, stab them repeatedly, or slash their throats with a knife. Some weapons allow players to blow up enemies, resulting in chunks of flesh/blood strewn around game environments; large robots/mech suits sometimes crush enemies' heads or bodies. A handful of sequences depict bodies incinerated/mutilated by torture devices. During the course of the game, characters sometimes engage in sexual activity (e.g., a man thrusting against a woman on a table; a woman gyrating on top of a man in bed—camera angles largely obscure the sex act and no nudity is depicted.). The game includes a sequence in which two characters ingest a hallucinogenic drug from a liquid dropper; the screen becomes blurry and distorted. The words “f**k” and “sh*t” appear in the dialogue.","rating":6},"pegi":{"synopsis":"The content of this game is suitable for persons aged 18 years and over only.\r\nIt contains: Extreme violence - Multiple, motiveless killing - Violence towards defenceless people - Strong language.","rating":5},"websites":[{"category":2,"url":"http://wolfenstein.wikia.com/wiki/Wolfenstein:_The_New_Order"},{"category":13,"url":"https://store.steampowered.com/app/201810"},{"category":1,"url":"http://www.wolfenstein.com"},{"category":8,"url":"https://www.instagram.com/wolfenstein"},{"category":5,"url":"https://twitter.com/wolfenstein"},{"category":4,"url":"https://www.facebook.com/Wolfenstein"},{"category":3,"url":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wolfenstein:_The_New_Order"}],"external":{"steam":"201810"}}]

The legion is a league of warriors deeply involved in the war between the Orcs and the Goblins on one side and their persecutors, Humankind, on the other. As a veteran warrior who has seen the most brutal of battles, the player is appointed by the Orc commander to complete a mission that could change the course of the war, to kill the Emperor himself, the man responsible for the bloodshed. A Goblin, Styx, soon joins the player, an unlikely but indispensable ally.","collection":872,"rating":77.0370540967842,"popularity":1.333333333333333,"aggregated_rating":80,"aggregated_rating_count":1,"total_rating":78.5185270483921,"total_rating_count":9,"rating_count":8,"games":[27421,18822,3025,11214,21429,1887,1942,6732,7533,11567],"tags":[1,17,268435468,536871008,536871041,536871044,536871139,536871208,536871864,536871938,536871945,536872070,536872647,536872847,536873053,536873066,536873384,536873473,536874916,536875046,536875047,536875062,536875099,536875157,536875161,536875196,536875199,536875253,536875265,536875281,536875302,536875306,536875307,536875316,536875372,536875425,536875437,536875464,536875492,536875494,536875593,536875609,536875623,536875668,536875792,536875808,536875809,536875910,536876008,536876707,536876770,536876911,536876981,536877531,536877643,536878359,536878415,536878470,536878525,536878531,536879087,536880299,536880303,536880958,536882816,1073741826],"developers":[405,404],"publishers":[110],"category":0,"player_perspectives":[2],"game_modes":[1,2,3],"keywords":[96,129,132,227,296,952,1026,1033,1158,1735,1935,2141,2154,2472,2561,4004,4134,4135,4150,4187,4245,4249,4284,4287,4341,4353,4369,4390,4394,4395,4404,4460,4513,4525,4552,4580,4582,4681,4697,4711,4756,4880,4896,4897,4998,5096,5795,5858,5999,6069,6619,6731,7447,7503,7558,7613,7619,8175,9387,9391,10046,11904],"themes":[1,17],"genres":[12],"first_release_date":1349913600000,"platforms":[6,9,12],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":6,"date":1349913600000,"region":8,"human":"2012-Oct-11","y":2012,"m":10},{"category":0,"platform":9,"date":1350000000000,"region":1,"human":"2012-Oct-12","y":2012,"m":10},{"category":0,"platform":12,"date":1350000000000,"region":1,"human":"2012-Oct-12","y":2012,"m":10},{"category":0,"platform":6,"date":1350000000000,"region":2,"human":"2012-Oct-12","y":2012,"m":10},{"category":0,"platform":6,"date":1350518400000,"region":3,"human":"2012-Oct-18","y":2012,"m":10},{"category":0,"platform":9,"date":1350345600000,"region":2,"human":"2012-Oct-16","y":2012,"m":10},{"category":0,"platform":9,"date":1350518400000,"region":3,"human":"2012-Oct-18","y":2012,"m":10},{"category":0,"platform":12,"date":1350518400000,"region":3,"human":"2012-Oct-18","y":2012,"m":10},{"category":0,"platform":12,"date":1351036800000,"region":2,"human":"2012-Oct-24","y":2012,"m":10}],"screenshots":[{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/hmnvlaeadqc3zshwj3ud.jpg","cloudinary_id":"hmnvlaeadqc3zshwj3ud","width":1280,"height":720},{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/ahnrvqpfqtnmb8lseqgv.jpg","cloudinary_id":"ahnrvqpfqtnmb8lseqgv","width":1280,"height":720},{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/lmgqzdkkrwbelwc9pdn6.jpg","cloudinary_id":"lmgqzdkkrwbelwc9pdn6","width":1280,"height":720},{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/ff1oedtjrusdqvxmvv0j.jpg","cloudinary_id":"ff1oedtjrusdqvxmvv0j","width":1280,"height":720},{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/gyvxfzfugne1s3oky5pf.jpg","cloudinary_id":"gyvxfzfugne1s3oky5pf","width":1280,"height":720}],"videos":[{"name":"Teaser","video_id":"I-C3LBUoQw8"},{"name":"Buddy trailer","video_id":"y9T6hdS9Q-Y"},{"name":"Launch trailer","video_id":"IedPilgoINE"}],"cover":{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/csghpefe8wbv2ze94wsw.jpg","cloudinary_id":"csghpefe8wbv2ze94wsw","width":1112,"height":1167},"esrb":{"synopsis":"","rating":6},"pegi":{"synopsis":"The content of this game is suitable for persons aged 16 years and over only.\r\r\nIt contains: Realistic looking violence - Strong language","rating":5},"external":{"steam":"216910"}}]

Run, jump, drag, shove and laser your way through the ultimately ancient scenery, gain back those underpants!","rating":55.1801521915239,"popularity":1.333333333333333,"aggregated_rating":78.75,"aggregated_rating_count":4,"total_rating":66.96507609576194,"total_rating_count":17,"rating_count":13,"games":[6732,7344,1331,12597,5601,6958,7342,7386,9061,16992],"tags":[17,27,33,268435464,268435465,268435487,268435488,536871029,536871033,536871072,536871115,536871138,536871186,536871262,536871400,536871470,536871487,536871577,536871878,536871945,536872070,536872124,536872205,536872307,536872352,536872419,536872695,536872862,536872961,536873053,536874398,536874452,536874745,536874916,536875046,536875062,536875072,536875073,536875074,536875081,536875089,536875109,536875151,536875208,536875228,536875244,536875271,536875310,536875322,536875364,536875377,536875396,536875437,536875438,536875439,536875453,536875484,536875485,536875492,536875493,536875521,536875527,536875531,536875534,536875536,536875537,536875554,536875593,536875675,536875689,536875693,536875761,536875815,536875819,536875832,536875840,536875896,536875903,536875934,536876011,536876015,536876023,536876026,536876028,536876029,536876031,536876073,536876174,536876187,536876196,536876199,536876205,536876243,536876299,536876320,536876337,536876365,536876415,536876445,536876499,536876506,536876509,536876552,536876563,536876569,536876727,536876880,536876966,536877216,536877280,536877333,536877424,536877456,536877518,536877713,536877764,536877806,536878217,536878374,536878417,536878520,536878596,536881118,1073741826],"developers":[1450],"publishers":[1450],"category":0,"player_perspectives":[2],"game_modes":[1],"keywords":[117,121,160,203,226,274,350,488,558,575,665,966,1033,1158,1212,1293,1395,1440,1507,1783,1950,2049,2141,3486,3540,3833,4004,4134,4150,4160,4161,4162,4169,4177,4197,4239,4296,4316,4332,4359,4398,4410,4452,4465,4484,4525,4526,4527,4541,4572,4573,4580,4581,4609,4615,4619,4622,4624,4625,4642,4681,4763,4777,4781,4849,4903,4907,4920,4928,4984,4991,5022,5099,5103,5111,5114,5116,5117,5119,5161,5262,5275,5284,5287,5293,5331,5387,5408,5425,5453,5503,5533,5587,5594,5597,5640,5651,5657,5815,5968,6054,6304,6368,6421,6512,6544,6606,6801,6852,6894,7305,7462,7505,7608,7684,10206],"themes":[17,27,33],"genres":[8,9,31,32],"first_release_date":1340064000000,"platforms":[6,14,3],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":14,"date":1340064000000,"region":8,"human":"2012-Jun-19","y":2012,"m":6},{"category":0,"platform":6,"date":1340064000000,"region":8,"human":"2012-Jun-19","y":2012,"m":6},{"category":0,"platform":3,"date":1340064000000,"region":8,"human":"2012-Jun-19","y":2012,"m":6}],"screenshots":[{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/rmekl4hxp3y4d09wupf0.jpg","cloudinary_id":"rmekl4hxp3y4d09wupf0","width":1920,"height":1080},{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/ars6whllohv4nuntvsyl.jpg","cloudinary_id":"ars6whllohv4nuntvsyl","width":1920,"height":1080},{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/vcct2r2nvdo4iibgpq6y.jpg","cloudinary_id":"vcct2r2nvdo4iibgpq6y","width":1596,"height":982},{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/hvw1rxayswto9uz0txjf.jpg","cloudinary_id":"hvw1rxayswto9uz0txjf","width":1596,"height":982},{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/nmgjt0tjebh4yvehwkwq.jpg","cloudinary_id":"nmgjt0tjebh4yvehwkwq","width":1596,"height":982}],"videos":[{"name":"Trailer","video_id":"4e9oke6mOZs"}],"cover":{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/s1jheyrixm7p600cvt2o.jpg","cloudinary_id":"s1jheyrixm7p600cvt2o","width":1134,"height":1600},"websites":[{"category":1,"url":"http://www.tinyandbig.com"},{"category":13,"url":"https://store.steampowered.com/app/205910"}],"external":{"steam":"205910"}}]

If he plants seeds in the past, he'll find full-grown trees and vines when he returns to the present. \n \nReleased on the Game Boy Color system in 2001, The Legend of Zelda: Oracle of Ages™ and The Legend of Zelda: Oracle of Seasons represent the pinnacle of classic 2D Zelda gameplay. \n \nWhen played together, these two games offer an ultimate adventure not possible when each game is experienced on its own. The games feature a link system that unlocks access to additional content that you can't access any other way.","collection":106,"rating":80.3766831129613,"popularity":1.666666666666667,"aggregated_rating":95.3333333333333,"aggregated_rating_count":3,"total_rating":87.85500822314731,"total_rating_count":31,"rating_count":28,"games":[1026,2909,1029,1036,12597,12517,7346,1032,6958,1028],"tags":[1,268435468,268435487,536870916,536870928,536871044,536871082,536871139,536871186,536871208,536871213,536871384,536871470,536871506,536871814,536871878,536871931,536871945,536872010,536872092,536872093,536872232,536872291,536872293,536872425,536872611,536872647,536872690,536873030,536873066,536873111,536873192,536873224,536873236,536873249,536873326,536873362,536873384,536873454,536873914,536874398,536874706,536874743,536874745,536874813,536874831,536874943,536875050,536875059,536875073,536875074,536875075,536875081,536875083,536875100,536875101,536875124,536875131,536875200,536875212,536875215,536875228,536875251,536875258,536875262,536875300,536875305,536875308,536875330,536875340,536875342,536875344,536875356,536875421,536875434,536875499,536875523,536875524,536875525,536875534,536875537,536875546,536875587,536875606,536875609,536875637,536875639,536875675,536875692,536875741,536875744,536875745,536875758,536875764,536875778,536875822,536875830,536875855,536875870,536875912,536875916,536875934,536875944,536875951,536876011,536876012,536876016,536876021,536876028,536876029,536876030,536876033,536876087,536876121,536876214,536876264,536876287,536876361,536876427,536876430,536876447,536876473,536876492,536876499,536876614,536876625,536876753,536876813,536877059,536877072,536877114,536877237,536877560,536877567,536877620,536877658,536877721,536877722,536877727,536877732,536877733,536877734,536877735,536877780,536877800,536878127,536878129,536878130,536878131,536878132,536878139,536878142,536878143,536878145,536878147,536878335,536878391,536878439,536878483,536878488,536878524,536878531,536878601,536878611,536879022,536879106,536880111,536880113,536880114,536880116,536880118,536880133,536880285,536880512,536880539,536880668,536881884,536882693,536882952,536882953,536882955,536882961,536886320,536886323,536887081,1073741827],"developers":[37,70],"publishers":[70],"category":0,"player_perspectives":[3],"game_modes":[1],"keywords":[4,16,132,170,227,274,296,301,472,558,594,902,966,1019,1033,1098,1180,1181,1320,1379,1381,1513,1699,1735,1778,2118,2154,2199,2280,2312,2324,2337,2414,2450,2472,2542,3002,3486,3794,3831,3833,3901,3919,4031,4138,4147,4161,4162,4163,4169,4171,4188,4189,4212,4219,4288,4300,4303,4316,4339,4346,4350,4388,4393,4396,4418,4428,4430,4432,4444,4509,4522,4587,4611,4612,4613,4622,4625,4634,4675,4694,4697,4725,4727,4763,4780,4829,4832,4833,4846,4852,4866,4910,4918,4943,4958,5000,5004,5022,5032,5039,5099,5100,5104,5109,5116,5117,5118,5121,5175,5209,5302,5352,5375,5449,5515,5518,5535,5561,5580,5587,5702,5713,5841,5901,6147,6160,6202,6325,6648,6655,6708,6746,6809,6810,6815,6820,6821,6822,6823,6868,6888,7215,7217,7218,7219,7220,7227,7230,7231,7233,7235,7423,7479,7527,7571,7576,7612,7619,7689,7699,8110,8194,9199,9201,9202,9204,9206,9221,9373,9600,9627,9756,10972,11781,12040,12041,12043,12049,15408,15411,16169],"themes":[1],"genres":[12,31],"first_release_date":983232000000,"platforms":[22,37],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":37,"date":1369872000000,"region":3,"human":"2013-May-30","y":2013,"m":5},{"category":0,"platform":37,"date":1369872000000,"region":1,"human":"2013-May-30","y":2013,"m":5},{"category":0,"platform":37,"date":1369872000000,"region":2,"human":"2013-May-30","y":2013,"m":5},{"category":0,"platform":37,"date":1361923200000,"region":5,"human":"2013-Feb-27","y":2013,"m":2},{"category":0,"platform":22,"date":1002240000000,"region":1,"human":"2001-Oct-05","y":2001,"m":10},{"category":0,"platform":22,"date":989798400000,"region":2,"human":"2001-May-14","y":2001,"m":5},{"category":0,"platform":22,"date":983232000000,"region":5,"human":"2001-Feb-27","y":2001,"m":2}],"alternative_names":[{"name":"Zelda no Densetsu: Fushigi na Ki no Mi -

Each choice carries weight, and your actions can lead to a variety of outcomes. Inquisition is a highly personalized journey, where one wrong move could set in motion a series of events that alter the physical aspects of the world itself, making your Thedas – and your heroes – feel truly unique. \n \nA Massive World to Discover – The world of Thedas has never been bigger or more detailed; it’s wide open, and ripe for exploration. Discover enemy keeps ripe for the taking. Unearth hidden caves filled with lurking creatures. Thedas is vast and dangerous, but uncovering its secrets can spell the difference between victory and defeat. \n \nIntense, Strategic Combat – There’s no wrong way to play Dragon Age: Inquisition… except for the way that gets you killed.

Violent sequences are often highlighted by cries of pain, gurgling/gushing sounds, and large blood-splatter effects; blood remains on the ground in several environments. The game includes some sexual material: a female character briefly depicted in front of a man's torso (fellatio is implied); characters depicted topless or with exposed buttocks while lying in bed or after sex; some dialogue referencing sex/sexuality (e.g., “'I will bring myself sexual pleasure later, while thinking about this with great respect'” and “The way your t*ts bounce when I pin your arms and take you on the side of the bed…”). The words “f**k,” “sh*t,” and “a*shole” appear in dialogue.","rating":6},"pegi":{"synopsis":"The content of this game is suitable for persons aged 18 years and over only.\r\nIt contains: Extreme violence - Strong language\r\nThis game allows the player to interact with other players ONLINE.","rating":5},"websites":[{"category":9,"url":"https://www.youtube.com/user/dragonageofficial"},{"category":8,"url":"https://www.instagram.com/dragonagegame"},{"category":5,"url":"https://twitter.com/dragonage"},{"category":4,"url":"https://www.facebook.com/dragonage"},{"category":3,"url":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dragon_Age:_Inquisition"},{"category":2,"url":"http://dragonage.wikia.com/wiki/Dragon_Age:_Inquisition"},{"category":1,"url":"http://www.dragonage.com/"}]}]

In line with the contemporary film productions, the 2010 game's storyline follows the first portion of the final novel in J.K. Rowling's Harry Potter series. From a third-person 3D perspective, players explore perilous scenes detailed in the book, and engage in action-oriented battle using powerful blasts from their magic wands. Xbox 360 gamers with the Kinect camera-control system can also cast spells simply by waving their hands in magical patterns. Two players can team up in cooperative multiplayer, taking the roles of any of the three main characters. The video game adventure is set away from the familiar school grounds for the first time, following Harry, Ron, and Hermione on a run for their lives from the forces of Voldemort, who has come to control the governing Ministry of Magic, as well as the once-safe Hogwarts academy. \n \nGuiding the three young heroes, players travel to remote and dangerous locations in a desperate quest to destroy the Horcruxes, objects of great power that are the secret to Voldemort's immortality. Different objectives and battles are best won by using the various special abilities of each character, calling on them to work together to overcome each series of challenges. No longer mere students, sheltered from the dangers of the world of magic by Professor Dumbledore and their other wise and kind teachers, Harry and his friends must face ferocious monsters, grim Death Eaters, and powerful rival wizards who have allied with the Dark One. The game also features magical battles against monsters and villains from earlier Harry Potter books, offering players a chance to further hone their wand-wielding skills. The dangers of the Deathly Hallows are greater than any he has faced before, but surviving this first part of the final adventure is the only way to prepare \"The Boy Who Lived\" to meet his destiny, in an inevitable showdown against Voldemort when the story comes to its conclusion.","collection":1502,"franchise":133,"franchises":[133],"rating":64.4313269119917,"popularity":1.333333333333333,"aggregated_rating":41,"aggregated_rating_count":6,"total_rating":52.71566345599585,"total_rating_count":19,"rating_count":13,"games":[27421,3025,19441,6958,536,529,26401,1352,1887,7323],"tags":[1,17,23,268435461,536871059,536871138,536871208,536871226,536871470,536871506,536871937,536871945,536872182,536872198,536872205,536872214,536872352,536872390,536872450,536872550,536872668,536872695,536872715,536872883,536874743,536875046,536875054,536875081,536875083,536875157,536875199,536875254,536875265,536875271,536875275,536875316,536875342,536875350,536875437,536875438,536875488,536875492,536875523,536875525,536875536,536875610,536875623,536875650,536875700,536875743,536875760,536875791,536875804,536875831,536875941,536876036,536876171,536876184,536876260,536876285,536876363,536876445,536876476,536876695,536876770,536876808,536876816,536877029,536877030,536877149,536877204,536877211,536877286,536877993,536877998,536878369,536878441,536878531,536879211,536879591,536879698,536879758,536879769,536880068,536880223,536880360,536880907,536882488,536883375,536883426,1073741825,1073741826],"developers":[2142],"publishers":[1],"game_engines":[542],"category":0,"player_perspectives":[1,2],"game_modes":[1],"keywords":[147,226,296,314,558,594,1025,1033,1270,1286,1293,1302,1440,1478,1538,1638,1756,1783,1803,1971,3831,4134,4142,4169,4171,4245,4287,4342,4353,4359,4363,4404,4430,4438,4525,4526,4576,4580,4611,4613,4624,4698,4711,4738,4788,4831,4848,4879,4892,4919,5029,5124,5259,5272,5348,5373,5451,5533,5564,5783,5858,5896,5904,6117,6118,6237,6292,6299,6374,7081,7086,7457,7529,7619,8299,8679,8786,8846,8857,9156,9311,9448,9995,11576,12463,12514],"themes":[1,17,23],"genres":[5],"first_release_date":1289865600000,"platforms":[6,9,12,20,5],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":5,"date":1290124800000,"region":1,"human":"2010-Nov-19","y":2010,"m":11},{"category":0,"platform":5,"date":1289865600000,"region":2,"human":"2010-Nov-16","y":2010,"m":11},{"category":0,"platform":9,"date":1290124800000,"region":1,"human":"2010-Nov-19","y":2010,"m":11},{"category":0,"platform":9,"date":1289865600000,"region":2,"human":"2010-Nov-16","y":2010,"m":11},{"category":0,"platform":5,"date":1289865600000,"human":"2010-Nov-16","y":2010,"m":11},{"category":0,"platform":6,"date":1289865600000,"human":"2010-Nov-16","y":2010,"m":11},{"category":0,"platform":20,"date":1289865600000,"human":"2010-Nov-16","y":2010,"m":11},{"category":0,"platform":9,"date":1289865600000,"human":"2010-Nov-16","y":2010,"m":11},{"category":0,"platform":12,"date":1289865600000,"human":"2010-Nov-16","y":2010,"m":11}],"screenshots":[{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/ukmaz9ylwsx0j3ayx5lf.jpg","cloudinary_id":"ukmaz9ylwsx0j3ayx5lf","width":1280,"height":720},{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/o6mvz9sualqnwpmoxcqu.jpg","cloudinary_id":"o6mvz9sualqnwpmoxcqu","width":1280,"height":720},{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/bgsyo6wjmxiqdh5fhb92.jpg","cloudinary_id":"bgsyo6wjmxiqdh5fhb92","width":1280,"height":720},{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/dy5wyfdokky8suqe7tmu.jpg","cloudinary_id":"dy5wyfdokky8suqe7tmu","width":1280,"height":720},{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/k7ejy0uvhlk8xjj2lu6v.jpg","cloudinary_id":"k7ejy0uvhlk8xjj2lu6v","width":1280,"height":720},{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/rrhganpisug3iliye3bb.jpg","cloudinary_id":"rrhganpisug3iliye3bb","width":1280,"height":720},{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/nf0why3mtbsplrwsnpr2.jpg","cloudinary_id":"nf0why3mtbsplrwsnpr2","width":1280,"height":720},{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/up6uhjmmsf5vuu2lbhsr.jpg","cloudinary_id":"up6uhjmmsf5vuu2lbhsr","width":1280,"height":720},{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/im1uh3n9ytubdkm67pr7.jpg","cloudinary_id":"im1uh3n9ytubdkm67pr7","width":1280,"height":720}],"videos":[{"name":"Gameplay video","video_id":"74oPbZyHYJY"},{"name":"Trailer","video_id":"3qQw5qjrrCs"}],"cover":{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/kulehftbowem1cc74z5w.jpg","cloudinary_id":"kulehftbowem1cc74z5w","width":246,"height":304},"esrb":{"rating":5},"websites":[{"category":3,"url":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harry_Potter_and_the_Deathly_Hallows_%E2%80%93_Part_1_(video_game)"},{"category":2,"url":"http://harrypotter.wikia.com/wiki/Harry_Potter_and_the_Deathly_Hallows:_Part_1_(video_game)"}]}]

Sierra has recreated the universe of King's Quest, a world that one moment will pull at your heartstrings, the next moment place terror in your heart. Uniting the best programmers, artists, and musicians in the business, Sierra has created a constantly evolving universe where landscapes change from day to night, characters roam freely, and dramatic music interludes tantalize your emotions in a complicated tale of faith and mistrust. Your quest begins with a full-length cartoon and proceeds to plunge you into a fantasy world of mystery, intrigue and enough plot twists to confound even the most dedicated adventurer. \n \nEmbark upon a perilous journey into the darkest corners of the King's Quest universe.

The story begins in 1666, when a devil-worshipping cult called the Brotherhood of Hecate were conducting sinister experiments in London so as to take over the city and then the world. The Brotherhood tried to develop an elixir that would endow them with superhuman powers. However, rather than creating their intended superhumans, their experiments created only grotesque monsters. When they decided to use these creatures as an army of conquest, one of their number, Samuel Pepys, set their headquarters on fire, resulting in the First Great Fire of London. The game takes place in 1834 when London falls victim to several evil occurrences. Monster sightings are reported along with news of people mutating into ungodly creatures, and that the dead are waking from their graves and walking amongst the living.

[{"id":379,"name":"Metal Gear Solid 3: Snake Eater","slug":"metal-gear-solid-3-snake-eater","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/metal-gear-solid-3-snake-eater","created_at":1300437334000,"updated_at":1523872207351,"summary":"Metal Gear Solid 3: Snake Eater is the follow up to Metal Gear Solid 2: Sons of Liberty. It is the first prequel in the series, taking the series to the year 1964. The player takes the role as the series' original antagonist, Big Boss, then known as Naked Snake. \n \nMGS3 is the first game in the series to take place in a jungle. This unique setting created an opportunity for new mechanics. The player can adapt to the environment by swapping Snake's camouflage, hunt animals and gather plants for food. This iteration in the series introduced a new feature in which the player must apply medicine and perform medical procedures on Snake if he is damaged in combat. Apart from the survival themed features, the controls and gameplay of the game are very similar to Metal Gear Solid 2. Like other Metal Gear games, the focus is on stealth, but the player can go through the entire game like a shooter if they choose to. Throughout the game Snake acquires weapons of all types; non-lethal firearms, handguns, sniper rifles, machine guns, shotguns, sub-machine guns, and explosives.  \n \nMetal Gear Solid 3 was the first game to implement the CQC (close quarters combat) system. CQC allowed Snake to beat enemies down to knock them out, or put them in a chokehold to knock them out, kill them, or and/or question them.  \n \nMetal Gear Solid 3's health system required the player to occasionally pause the game and treat Snake's ailments. When Snake is shot, there is a chance that the bullet didn't pass through him, requiring the player to use a knife to remove the bullet, apply disinfectant, apply styptic and bandage the wound. This was done through a submenu in the pause screen. Other ailments the player must treat Snake for include: leeches, broken bones, burns, cut, arrow/bolts/needles, stomach sickness, colds, and food/venom poisoning. \n \nAdding to the survival elements of the game, Snake Eater lives up to its name by requiring the player to scavenge food for Snake. Under the life bar there is stamina bar. If Snake does not eat any food the bar depletes, causing various effects. When the stamina bar is low, the player's ability to aim is severely handicapped, Snake's hands will shake in the first person aiming mode. Just like real life, Snake's stomach can also rumble, enemy soldiers can hear this, and will be alerted to Snake's

[{"id":1726,"name":"Mega Man & Bass","slug":"mega-man-bass","url":"https://www.igdb.com/games/mega-man-bass","created_at":1352059251199,"updated_at":1518071560456,"summary":"The story of Mega Man & Bass varies slightly depending on which player character is chosen. It begins when a robot villain named King breaks into Dr. Wily's laboratory and then the Robot Museum to collect the data blueprints for the creations of Dr. Light. Dr. Light alerts the hero Mega Man that he must go at once to the Robot Museum to confront this new enemy. Meanwhile, Bass (Mega Man's rival and Wily's greatest creation) hears of the new criminal's appearance and decides to prove himself the stronger robot by defeating King. Proto Man is the first to arrive at the scene. King divulges his plan to him; he desires to create a utopia in which robots rule the world over humans. To accomplish this, King seeks to create an unstoppable army using the data and invites Proto Man to join him. Proto Man refuses and attempts to attack, but King counters and slices his body in half. Proto Man then teleports back to the lab for repairs while King escapes with the data. With their own motivations, Mega Man and Bass set out to put a stop to King's plans. \n \nAfter vanquishing eight powerful robots under allegiance to King, the duo infiltrates his castle and engages him in combat. Proto Man interrupts the fight and again attempts to defeat their new nemesis. Putting all of his remaining energy into a blast, Proto Man manages to destroy King's shield and loses consciousness, allowing Mega Man and Bass to best King in battle afterwards. King questions why they fight so hard for humans when robots are the superior species. The pair explains that humans are the ones who created robots in the first place, which confuses King. The villain reveals that his creator is Dr. Wily, who then appears on a video monitor. When King asks the evil inventor why robots fight each other for the sake of humans, Wily strengthens his \"brainwashing level\" and restores his power. Mega Man and Bass engage King in another battle and defeat him. The castle begins a self-destruct sequence and the protagonists escape without King. \n \nMega and Bass begin a final confrontation with Dr. Wily in his newly-regained laboratory. When Wily is beaten, Bass demands to know why he deceived him. Wily explains that he created King simply to test Bass' abilities because of his past failures in challenging Mega Man. Wily shows him written plans for making a newer version of King to join with Bass in this venture, promising that the two would be invincible together. Proto Man appears and immediately destroys these plans. Proto Man tells Bass that although he is a strong robot of free will, he can never defeat his rival because he has nothing for which to fight. Mega Man returns home where his sister Roll presents him a letter from King. King wishes to atone for his own crimes against humans and hopes for them to be friends if they were meet in the future.","collection":337,"franchise":38,"franchises":[38],"rating":60.5679867078971,"popularity":1.333333333333333,"total_rating":60.5679867078971,"total_rating_count":4,"rating_count":4,"games":[55752,68287,21063,36950,27314,26766,19174,10039,11156,25300],"tags":[1,18,268435461,268435464,536870990,536871208,536871882,536871937,536871971,536872225,536872587,536872961,536873021,536873064,536874398,536874745,536875073,536875097,536875104,536875298,536875434,536875437,536875464,536875472,536875848,536876353,536876499,536877008,536877230,536877331,536877607,536877608,536878004,536878085,536879696,536880072,536880263,536880390,536882224,1073741828],"developers":[37],"publishers":[37],"category":0,"player_perspectives":[4],"game_modes":[1],"keywords":[78,296,970,1025,1059,1313,1675,2049,2109,2152,3486,3833,4161,4185,4192,4386,4522,4525,4552,4560,4936,5441,5587,6096,6318,6419,6695,6696,7092,7173,8784,9160,9351,9478,11312],"themes":[1,18],"genres":[5,8],"first_release_date":893376000000,"platforms":[41,24,58],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":41,"date":1376352000000,"region":1,"human":"2013-Aug-13","y":2013,"m":8},{"category":0,"platform":41,"date":1430956800000,"region":2,"human":"2015-May-07","y":2015,"m":5},{"category":0,"platform":24,"date":1028937600000,"human":"2002-Aug-10","y":2002,"m":8},{"category":0,"platform":58,"date":893376000000,"human":"1998-Apr-24","y":1998,"m":4}],"alternative_names":[{"name":"Rockman and Forte","comment":"Other"},{"name":"Rockman & Forte"}],"screenshots":[{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/jvkaokmkggaoqwck2dgn.jpg","cloudinary_id":"jvkaokmkggaoqwck2dgn","width":745,"height":419},{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/iotzupvlnr4qf7t6f80a.jpg","cloudinary_id":"iotzupvlnr4qf7t6f80a","width":745,"height":419},{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/kjmmfaeg05gle8y0obxa.jpg","cloudinary_id":"kjmmfaeg05gle8y0obxa","width":745,"height":419}],"cover":{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/zmfjlvhgtwwoclry6yk4.jpg","cloudinary_id":"zmfjlvhgtwwoclry6yk4","width":640,"height":645},"esrb":{"rating":3}}]

In one scene he rips off the leg of a voodoo doll, causing a zombie pirate to lose his arm and leg and spew out splashes of green blood. To solve one of the puzzles, players must compete in a drinking contest during which a character is depicted drinking a mug of grog. The grog is described as having \"twice the alcohol, twice the calories,\" and causes the character to pass out. There is also a scene that depicts a man spitting out green mucus, and players can compete in a spitting contest.

is a role-playing adventure game based on the animated South Park TV show. Players assume the role of a new kid in town who embarks on various quests with other boys in the neighborhood. Players can engage in turn-based combat, selecting attacks from a menu screen. Players use various weapons (swords, baseball bats, hammers), magic spells and melee attacks during fights; blood-splatter effects sometimes occur. Cutscenes occasionally depict “cartoony” characters dismembered or decapitated. The game includes several instances of mature humor and sexual material: one extended sequence depicts characters getting anally probed by alien creatures; another sequence (in an abortion clinic) depicts doctors using a vacuum to perform procedures on male characters; one level takes place inside the rectum/colon of a character (sex toys, random objects and fecal matter appear in the level)—all sequences are depicted in a cartoony and over-the-top manner. Characters are occasionally depicted nude (e.g., breasts, buttocks, male genitalia); one extended sequence depicts an out-of-focus couple having sex in the background; as players engage in turn-based battle in the foreground, sexual moaning sounds/dialogue is heard. During the course of the game, drug paraphernalia can be seen strewn around a methamphetamine lab. The words “f**k,” “sh*t,” “a*shole,” and “f*ggot” can be heard in the dialogue.","rating":6},"pegi":{"synopsis":"The content of this game is suitable for persons aged 18 years and over only.\r\nIt contains: Extreme violence - Graphic sexual activity showing genitalia - Sexual violence - Strong language.","rating":5},"websites":[{"category":3,"url":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/South_Park:_The_Stick_of_Truth"},{"category":2,"url":"http://southpark.wikia.com/wiki/South_Park:_The_Stick_of_Truth"},{"category":13,"url":"https://store.steampowered.com/app/213670"},{"category":1,"url":"http://southpark.ubi.com/stickoftruth/en-us/home/index.aspx"}],"external":{"steam":"213670"},"multiplayer_modes":[{"offlinecoop":false,"onlinecoop":false,"lancoop":false,"campaigncoop":false,"splitscreenonline":false,"splitscreen":false,"dropin":false}]}]

The controls consist of accelerator, brake, \"tight turn\" (essentially a handbrake) and turbo on the face buttons, with main weapons and machine gun selection and control on the shoulder buttons.\n\nArenas are populated with weapon pickups to re-supply missile stocks, repair stations for repairing damage to your car, pedestrians, and course stewards armed with either machine guns or missile launchers.","collection":709,"franchise":361,"franchises":[361],"rating":75.9377469898352,"popularity":2.333333333333333,"aggregated_rating":75,"aggregated_rating_count":5,"total_rating":75.4688734949176,"total_rating_count":19,"rating_count":14,"games":[4696,4697,5413,4698,5414,5417,10039,11198,665,19561],"tags":[1,20,21,268435460,268435461,268435466,536870937,536871470,536871537,536871618,536872352,536872651,536872695,536873512,536874398,536874539,536875069,536875098,536875122,536875152,536875179,536875198,536875284,536875606,536875691,536875707,536875715,536875819,536875825,536876066,536876199,536876235,536876240,536876293,536876415,536876419,536876513,536876570,536877160,536877169,536877285,536877744,536877938,536877982,536878439,536879827,536880441,536880761,536880837,536883622,536884026,536884377,1073741826],"developers":[2098],"publishers":[45],"category":0,"player_perspectives":[2],"game_modes":[1,2],"keywords":[25,558,625,706,1440,1739,1783,2600,3486,3627,4157,4186,4210,4240,4267,4286,4372,4694,4779,4795,4803,4907,4913,5154,5287,5323,5328,5381,5503,5507,5601,5658,6248,6257,6373,6832,7026,7070,7527,8915,9529,9849,9925,12710,13114,13465],"themes":[1,20,21],"genres":[4,5,10],"first_release_date":815529600000,"pulse_count":4,"platforms":[45,7],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":7,"date":815529600000,"human":"1995-Nov-05","y":1995,"m":11},{"category":0,"platform":45,"date":1298419200000,"human":"2011-Feb-23","y":2011,"m":2}],"screenshots":[{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/domjnzi6rudznfiwk6cs.jpg","cloudinary_id":"domjnzi6rudznfiwk6cs","width":480,"height":355}],"cover":{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/nhvrpnncuojx7lrymoxp.jpg","cloudinary_id":"nhvrpnncuojx7lrymoxp","width":275,"height":400},"esrb":{"rating":5},"websites":[{"category":2,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Twisted_Metal"}]}]

A 2 x 2 square (an O tetromino) made of four smaller block pieces is dropped into the playing field, which may appear different as the player advances through levels or skins. The small blocks that comprise the larger blocks will be one of two different colors. The objective is to rotate and align the blocks in such a way as to create 2x2 squares of the same color, which may span multiple blocks and, indeed, share blocks. For example, if one should get a 2x3 area of matching blocks, the middle portion will \"share\" itself with both the left and right halves and create two 2x2 squares. After the \"timeline\", which is synchronized to the music, sweeps over the matching blocks, they disappear. When too many unmatched blocks pile up to the point where no more blocks may be dropped in the playing field, the game ends. \nWhen part of a falling block hits an obstruction, the unobstructed portion of the block will split off and continue to fall. More points are scored by creating the largest number of squares during one \"timeline\" sweep. Increasing score multipliers are earned by repeatedly clearing squares on consecutive timeline sweeps. Bonuses are also awarded by reducing all remaining tiles to one single color or for removing all non-active tiles from the screen altogether. \nOccasionally, a block falls with a special square of one of the two colors with a \"jewel\" in the center. This square, when cleared as part of a matched 2x2 square, will cause all individual blocks of the same color that are horizontally or vertically adjacent to the matched 2x2 square, or to an adjacent square, to be cleared without score. These can be used for both generating large bonuses, since generally several blocks of the other color will be formed once these are removed, as well as to help the player recover if the field becomes too cluttered.","rating":83.124870766435,"popularity":1.333333333333333,"aggregated_rating":85,"aggregated_rating_count":5,"total_rating":84.06243538321749,"total_rating_count":13,"rating_count":8,"games":[27266,4693,19222,41348,36792,25222,25646,236,27725,10225],"tags":[35,268435465,536871081,536871115,1073741828],"developers":[786,61,1431],"publishers":[786,61,1431,104],"category":0,"player_perspectives":[4],"game_modes":[1,2],"keywords":[169,203],"themes":[35],"genres":[9],"first_release_date":1102809600000,"platforms":[45,6,39,36,38,55,8],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":38,"date":1102809600000,"human":"2004-Dec-12","y":2004,"m":12},{"category":0,"platform":55,"date":1141171200000,"human":"2006-Mar-01","y":2006,"m":3},{"category":0,"platform":8,"date":1171756800000,"human":"2007-Feb-18","y":2007,"m":2},{"category":1,"platform":6,"date":1196467200000,"human":"2007-Dec","y":2007,"m":12},{"category":0,"platform":36,"date":1161129600000,"human":"2006-Oct-18","y":2006,"m":10},{"category":0,"platform":45,"date":1229558400000,"human":"2008-Dec-18","y":2008,"m":12},{"category":1,"platform":39,"date":1251763200000,"human":"2009-Sep","y":2009,"m":9}],"screenshots":[{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/frj7es6ak4g6if4bs3df.jpg","cloudinary_id":"frj7es6ak4g6if4bs3df","width":960,"height":540},{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/gho1yattixqth0skvueo.jpg","cloudinary_id":"gho1yattixqth0skvueo","width":960,"height":540},{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/d5ovnsnje55odia1mjtq.jpg","cloudinary_id":"d5ovnsnje55odia1mjtq","width":960,"height":540},{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/j7bg8nax9azvoizhildo.jpg","cloudinary_id":"j7bg8nax9azvoizhildo","width":960,"height":540},{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/qmtdiyyqcolrhpjumx9t.jpg","cloudinary_id":"qmtdiyyqcolrhpjumx9t","width":480,"height":272}],"cover":{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/yo2tsleedsdyo8hjbeke.jpg","cloudinary_id":"yo2tsleedsdyo8hjbeke","width":292,"height":500},"websites":[{"category":13,"url":"https://store.steampowered.com/app/11900"},{"category":2,"url":"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lumines"}],"external":{"steam":"11900"}}]

In addition, there are eight alternative-modes for these characters to unlock, plus dozens of secret characters to obtain. With a multi-tap, up to four players can play, with rules governing how much they can hurt each other.

Designed and produced by Hiromichi Tanaka, it was released in Japan on May 16, 2002, for PlayStation 2 and Microsoft Windows-based personal computers in November of that year. The game was the first cross-platform MMORPG and the Xbox 360's first MMORPG.[1] All versions of the game require a monthly subscription to play.[2] \n \nThe story is set in the fantasy world of Vana'diel, where player-created avatars can both compete and cooperate in a variety of objectives to develop an assortment of jobs, skills, and earn in-game item rewards. Players can undertake an array of quests and progress through the in-game hierarchy and through the major plot of the game. Since its debut in 2002, five expansion packs have been released[3] along with six add-on scenarios. Each expansion pack and add-on brings a new major storyline to the Final Fantasy XI world, along with numerous areas, quests, events and item rewards. \n \nIn March 2015, Square Enix announced that Final Fantasy XI would receive one more final main scenario (spread out over three parts in 2015). The servers for the game PlayStation 2 and Xbox 360 versions will be shut down in 2016.[4] A mobile client for the game is under development by Square Enix in collaboration with Korean developer Nexon,[5] and a spinoff mobile game, Final Fantasy Grandmasters is under development with a 2015 release date.","collection":39,"franchise":4,"franchises":[4],"popularity":1.333333333333333,"aggregated_rating":90,"aggregated_rating_count":1,"total_rating":90,"total_rating_count":1,"games":[80589,416,23198,47823,7202,26766,18822,5602,36926,16474],"tags":[1,17,268435468,268435487,536870988,536871139,536871148,536871208,536871812,536873092,536873580,536874040,536875073,536875196,536875271,536875300,536875380,536875420,536875437,536875455,536875525,536875608,536875735,536875745,536875752,536875764,536875770,536875778,536875791,536875803,536875830,536876232,536876503,536876736,536876816,536876927,536877172,536877208,536877210,536877216,536877237,536877422,536877984,536878322,536878335,536878373,536878440,536878444,536879696,536879765,536879891,536879940,536880004,536880294,536880624,536880755,536880960,536881456,536881768,536882496,536882819,536884022,536885058,536885311,536885312,536885313,536885314,536885315,536885316,536885317,536886249,1073741826],"developers":[26],"publishers":[26],"category":0,"player_perspectives":[2],"game_modes":[5],"keywords":[76,227,236,296,900,2180,2668,3128,4161,4284,4359,4388,4468,4508,4525,4543,4613,4696,4823,4833,4840,4852,4858,4866,4879,4891,4918,5320,5591,5824,5904,6015,6260,6296,6298,6304,6325,6510,7072,7410,7423,7461,7528,7532,8784,8853,8979,9028,9092,9382,9712,9843,10048,10544,10856,11584,11907,13110,14146,14399,14400,14401,14402,14403,14404,14405,15337],"themes":[1,17],"genres":[12,31],"first_release_date":1095292800000,"platforms":[6,12,8],"release_dates":[{"category":0,"platform":8,"date":1095292800000,"human":"2004-Sep-16","y":2004,"m":9},{"category":0,"platform":6,"date":1095724800000,"human":"2004-Sep-21","y":2004,"m":9},{"category":0,"platform":12,"date":1145318400000,"human":"2006-Apr-18","y":2006,"m":4}],"alternative_names":[{"name":"CoP, FFXI: CoP\nFinal Fantasy 11 Online: Chains of Promathia","comment":"Other"}],"screenshots":[{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/cqom1lg0dvocpqwoesik.jpg","cloudinary_id":"cqom1lg0dvocpqwoesik","width":800,"height":600},{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/a8jwt3zwn8sk8uxofhsq.jpg","cloudinary_id":"a8jwt3zwn8sk8uxofhsq","width":800,"height":600},{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/fkh8kh6fsp2d7othwt4p.jpg","cloudinary_id":"fkh8kh6fsp2d7othwt4p","width":800,"height":600},{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/phqiwvbqncleyxycqssw.jpg","cloudinary_id":"phqiwvbqncleyxycqssw","width":800,"height":600},{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/bfnub2tyzsgcldtjbt9z.jpg","cloudinary_id":"bfnub2tyzsgcldtjbt9z","width":800,"height":600}],"cover":{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/scy7udp6ctioanopqqx4.jpg","cloudinary_id":"scy7udp6ctioanopqqx4","width":353,"height":500},"esrb":{"synopsis":"","rating":5}}]

Swords, guns, and magic attacks can be used to kill nearby adversaries; realistic gunfire and explosions can be heard during battle. Damage sometimes results in large blood-splatter effects, and some environments depict larger blood stains/smears on the ground. In one “meat store” scene, corpses can be seen hanging from meat hooks or lying on the ground. During the course of the game, one female succubus enemy is depicted topless; her breasts bounce up and down during combat. In one extended cutscene, a woman seductively caresses players' character before moving her head off-screen—oral sex is implied, though never shown. Some scenes reference drug use (e.g., “[Rome wasn't built] by deadbeat procrastinators lazying around on their asses smoking weed either,” “Have you ever seen a psychiatrist or taken psychedelic drugs?”); in one sequence, a man is depicted smoking a marijuana joint.

It was released for ten different 8 and 16-bit platforms, including MS-DOS, Atari ST, and Commodore 64. It is Infocom's nineteenth game. \n \nWith a circus-themed plot, the game's tagline was \"Big-time suspense under the Big Top!\" \n \nThe player's character is bedazzled by the spectacle of the circus and the mystery of the performer's life. After attending a show of Tomas Munrab's \"The Travelling Circus That Time Forgot\", the player loiters near the tents instead of rushing through the exit. Maybe some clowns will practice a new act, or perhaps at least one of the trapeze artists will trip... \n \nInstead, the player overhears a strange conversation. The circus' owner has hired a drunken, inept detective to find his daughter Chelsea, who has been kidnapped. Munrab is convinced that it was an outside job; surely his loyal employees would never betray him like this! \n \nAs the player begins to investigate the abduction, it soon becomes clear that the circus workers don't appreciate the intrusion. Their reactions range from indifference to hostility to attempted murder. In order to unravel the mystery, the player engages in a series of actions straight out of a circus fan's dream: dressing up as a clown, walking the high wire, and taming lions.","popularity":1.333333333333333,"games":[26163,25211,26223,28148,24665,75279,27266,29525,43130,25592],"tags":[43,268435487,536871130,536873308,536875172,536879130,536885978,1073741829],"developers":[368],"publishers":[368],"category":0,"player_perspectives":[5],"game_modes":[1],"keywords":[218,2396,4260,8218,15066],"themes":[43],"genres":[31],"first_release_date":536371200000,"platforms":[63,14,13,65,16,75,126,15,25,129],"release_dates":[{"category":2,"platform":13,"date":536371200000,"human":"1986","y":1986,"m":12},{"category":2,"platform":16,"date":536371200000,"region":2,"human":"1986","y":1986,"m":12},{"category":2,"platform":65,"date":536371200000,"region":2,"human":"1986","y":1986,"m":12},{"category":2,"platform":63,"date":536371200000,"region":2,"human":"1986","y":1986,"m":12},{"category":2,"platform":15,"date":536371200000,"region":2,"human":"1986","y":1986,"m":12},{"category":2,"platform":75,"date":536371200000,"region":2,"human":"1986","y":1986,"m":12},{"category":2,"platform":25,"date":536371200000,"region":1,"human":"1986","y":1986,"m":12},{"category":2,"platform":13,"date":536371200000,"region":2,"human":"1986","y":1986,"m":12},{"category":2,"platform":14,"date":536371200000,"region":2,"human":"1986","y":1986,"m":12},{"category":2,"platform":129,"date":631065600000,"region":2,"human":"1989","y":1989,"m":12},{"category":2,"platform":126,"date":536371200000,"region":2,"human":"1986","y":1986,"m":12}],"screenshots":[{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/kyqtelojzuaztwcocyit.jpg","cloudinary_id":"kyqtelojzuaztwcocyit","width":560,"height":384}],"cover":{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/p2tfvkwljngpd6w2uwfb.jpg","cloudinary_id":"p2tfvkwljngpd6w2uwfb","width":2174,"height":2671}}]

Shadow Warrior was developed using Ken Silverman's Build engine and improved on 3D Realms' previous Build engine game, Duke Nukem 3D. Mark Adams ported Shadow Warrior to Mac OS in August 1997.[1] \n \nThe game's improvements included introduction of true room-over-room situations, the use of 3D voxels instead of 2D sprites for weapons and usable inventory items, transparent water, climbable ladders, and assorted vehicles to drive (some armed with weapons). Although ultra-violent, the game emphasized tongue-in-cheek humor and contained some sexual themes (although less blatantly than in Duke Nukem 3D). A combination of Duke Nukem 3D and Shadow Warrior was published by GT Interactive in March 1998, titled East Meets West.[2]","storyline":"Lo Wang is a bodyguard for Zilla Enterprises, which has control over every major industry in Japan.

After surviving an attack on an orbiting Borogo cargo barge, a pilot enters one remaining fighter and challenges the Gidans in a desperate attempt to quell the alien invasion and divert their asteroid fortresses in the process.","collection":3589,"popularity":1.666666666666667,"games":[68287,36950,28029,64204,27314,71455,25300,142,11253,10209],"tags":[1,18,268435461,268435489,536871078,536871882,536875158,536878036,536885414,1073741827],"developers":[2073],"publishers":[11739,817],"category":0,"player_perspectives":[3],"game_modes":[1,2],"keywords":[166,970,4246,7124,14502],"themes":[1,18],"genres":[5,33],"first_release_date":599529600000,"platforms":[29,52,86],"release_dates":[{"category":2,"platform":52,"date":599529600000,"region":5,"human":"1988","y":1988,"m":12},{"category":0,"platform":86,"date":711936000000,"region":5,"human":"1992-Jul-24","y":1992,"m":7},{"category":0,"platform":29,"date":629164800000,"region":5,"human":"1989-Dec-09","y":1989,"m":12}],"alternative_names":[{"name":"Tatsujin","comment":"Other"},{"name":"タツジン","comment":"Japanese title"}],"cover":{"url":"//images.igdb.com/igdb/image/upload/t_thumb/xrgwh5oov82hhibzidaw.jpg","cloudinary_id":"xrgwh5oov82hhibzidaw","width":1446,"height":2000}}]

is a strategy game in which players manage a nation from a single settlement to a prominent civilization. Players can develop their nation's culture and technology, manage its economic and social infrastructure (e.g., diplomacy, trade), and expand territory through military conquests. Combat with nations is presented from an overhead perspective, and military units are represented by small armies of soldiers on a gridded map. Battles include brief animations of sword fighting, gun fights, and vehicular combat, resulting in icons exploding, collapsing, or disappearing. Nuclear weapons can be developed and detonated over opposing nation's territories. Historically based text includes descriptions of violence (e.g., assassinations, murders, suicides) and a reference to the opium drug trade (e.g., \"where they could engage in extremely profitable business including the infamous opium trade.\").","rating":4},"pegi":{"synopsis":"The content of this game is suitable for persons aged 12 years and over only.\r\nIt contains: Non realistic looking violence towards human characters\r\nThis game allows the player to interact with other players ONLINE","rating":3},"websites":[{"category":1,"url":"http://www.civilization.com"},{"category":3,"url":"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civilization_V"},{"category":2,"url":"http://civilization.wikia.com/wiki/Civilization_V"},{"category":13,"url":"https://store.steampowered.com/app/8930"}],"external":{"steam":"50100"}}]
